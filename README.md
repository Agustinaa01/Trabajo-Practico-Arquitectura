As digitalization continues to pervade daily operations. 

Our team aimed to provide a bespoke digital contact agenda solution for users' convenience. An Angular web application with an integrated "Trabajo práctico integrator" function was developed by our team providing a hub for users to manage all their contacts effortlessly and in one easy to navigate platform. Features include adding new contacts deleting obsolete ones and editing existing ones without any fuss. 

Our dedicated team of developers; Agustina Serra, Brenda Ahumadaand Luciano Pilot deliver this project from its infancy stage through project completion and are proud of the result - an efficient app that covers all aspects of contact management smoothly.
