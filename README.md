As digitalization continues to pervade daily operations.

An Angular web application with an integrated "Trabajo práctico integrator" function was developed by our team providing a hub for users to manage all their contacts effortlessly and in one easy to navigate platform. Features include adding new contacts deleting obsolete ones and editing existing ones without any fuss.
